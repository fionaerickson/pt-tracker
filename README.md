# PT & Gym Recovery Tracker

A web app for tracking physical therapy and gym sessions: a personal exercise
bank, fast in-session logging with adaptive prefills and progressive-overload
nudges, and a finish-of-session celebration with personal bests.

This repository is scaffolded directly against the build spec
(`pt-recovery-tracker-spec.md`), section 8's build order. The three pieces of
real business logic live as pure, unit-tested functions in `src/lib/logic`.

## Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) — one codebase for API routes + UI (spec §1).
- **MongoDB** via the official driver (spec §1).
- **TypeScript** throughout; **Vitest** for the logic unit tests.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env            # set MONGODB_URI, MONGODB_DB, DEFAULT_USER_ID
npm run setup:indexes           # create the §5 indexes (idempotent)
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

`npm test` runs the logic suite — no database required.

## Build-order map (spec §8 → code)

| Step | Spec | Code |
|------|------|------|
| 1. Collections + indexes | §4, §5 | `src/lib/types.ts`, `scripts/setupIndexes.ts` |
| 2. Exercise bank + search/filter | §6.7 | `src/lib/db/exercises.ts`, `api/exercises` |
| 3. Session lifecycle + greeting | §6.1 | `src/lib/db/workouts.ts` (`resolveSession`), `api/session`, `api/workouts` |
| 4. Logging: adaptive prefill + cart | §6.2, §6.4 | `src/lib/logic/prefill.ts`, `src/lib/db/logs.ts`, `api/exercises/:id/prefill`, `api/workouts/:id/logs` |
| 5. Progressive overload check | §6.3 | `src/lib/logic/overload.ts` |
| 6. Complete workout + PR cascade | §6.5, §6.6 | `src/lib/logic/prCascade.ts`, `completeWorkout`, `api/workouts/:id/complete` |
| 7. Stats + retrospective PR lookups | §6.8 | `rollingWorkoutCount`, `lastPrOnExercise`, `api/stats`, `api/exercises/:id/last-pr` |

## The three logic blocks (pure & verifiable)

Each is a pure function taking already-queried data so it can be unit-tested
without a database:

- **`checkOverload`** (§6.3) — two gates + stagnation test. `tests/overload.test.ts`
  encodes the spec's worked-example table verbatim.
- **`computePrefill`** (§6.2) — branches A (overload) / B (recent) / C (cold start).
- **`computePrs`** (§6.6) — the tier 1–5 cascade with both confirmed decisions baked
  in (new_max_weight = strictly heavier all-time; hard_day_consolation is a
  fallback that never co-appears with real PRs).

```bash
npm test   # 19 tests across the three logic blocks
```

## API surface

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET/POST | `/api/exercises` | list (filters: `equipment,tags,name,recency`) / create |
| GET/PATCH | `/api/exercises/:id` | read / edit |
| GET | `/api/exercises/:id/prefill` | adaptive prefill + overload nudge |
| GET | `/api/exercises/:id/last-pr` | last PR on this exercise |
| GET | `/api/session` | resolve app-open (`resume` / `stale` / `greet`) |
| POST | `/api/workouts` | start the cart from a readiness score |
| GET | `/api/workouts/current` | the open cart, if any |
| GET | `/api/workouts/:id` | read a workout + summary |
| GET/POST | `/api/workouts/:id/logs` | cart contents / add a row |
| POST | `/api/workouts/:id/complete` | finish: summary + PR cascade |
| PATCH/DELETE | `/api/logs/:id` | edit (incl. `rounds` quantity) / remove |
| GET | `/api/stats` | rolling 30-day completed-workout count |

## Open decisions (spec §7)

Safe defaults are implemented so the build is unblocked:

- **Stale in-progress cart** older than the greeting threshold → `resolveSession`
  returns `action: "stale"` and leaves the cart intact (resume; user discards
  manually).
- **`perceivedDifficulty`** is captured on logs but not yet wired into the
  overload check.
- **Progress-over-time view** is a fast-follow; the `logs` collection and hero
  index already support the query.

## Not yet built

This is a backend + logic scaffold. The front-end screens (greeting, bank
browser, logging screen, celebration/summary) are stubbed by the index page and
build on top of the documented API routes.
